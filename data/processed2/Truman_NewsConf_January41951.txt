 Please be seated.  I have no special announcements to make this morning. I will try to answer questions, however.  \. No. The House makes its own rules, and we will try and operate with the rules, as usual, hoping to get the program through in the usual manner.  \. I don't see how that message could have been delayed 1 week when Congress only started yesterday. If you look up the record, you will find that the message on the state of the Union is being delivered as promptly as it ever is in any year. It takes the Congress, anyhow, another a weeks to organize.  \. I have no comment.   What's the matter with these press conferences ? The last time I had it, I urged you to get up-- \. I will take care of that, May 1 when the time comes. It isn't here yet.  1  Mrs. May Craig of the Portland  Press Herald. \. I read something about it in the paper. I have not received any official notice of it.  2 On January 3, 1951, Representative Frederic R. Coudert, Jr., of New York, introduced a joint resolution  requiring congressional authorization for sending military forces abroad. The resolution was referred to the Committee on Armed Services. \. I said the proper action would be taken on that when the time came, but the time is not here yet. I hope it will never come.  \. The General is coming to see me, and after we have had a conference, I will comment on it.  3 On December 19, 1950, the President had designated General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower as Supreme Allied Commander, Europe . \. I think the date is Saturday morning. I'm not sure. I think that's it.  \. Not at all. There has been no change whatever. That was just a confusing question, Bob, 4  that's all it was.  4  Robert G. Nixon of International News Service. \. The answer was not confused. \. Yes. Intended for that purpose, May, I think. \. I have no comment to make on that, May. \. No--that is correct. We are carrying out an obligation for the United Nations. \. Carrying out an obligation for the United Nations, one which was assumed when we signed the charter.  \. I have that--do not have that under consideration. \. That might require the action that May is talking about.  \. I can't comment on that now. I sincerely hope, of course, personally, that we will not get into war. That has been my fight for 5 years. But I can't now comment on your question very well.  \. It has not been under consideration- \. It has not been under consideration. At least, not by me.  \. Sure. \. That's correct--that's correct. \. That is correct.  \. We are always hopeful for negotiations to settle the difficulty.  \. I have it under consideration.  \. That matter was answered yesterday by the Secretary of State just as it is--if you will read that--that statement of his was approved by me. 5     5 For the statement by Secretary of State Dean Acheson at his press conference on January 3, 1951, concerning the proposed foreign ministers meeting, see the Department of State Bulletin .  \. We are working on that all the time, and just as fast as we can get around to it. It is a tremendous job to set up a price control organization, and they are working on it constantly, and I think it will go into effect as fast as it is physically possible to get it done. \. That would require an amendment to the law. \. Control of the price of farm products. \. That is correct. As soon as it is possible to get it done. \. That's correct. \. I will let you know about that in the State of the Union Message. 6  6 Item 4, this volume. \. Yes.  \. I beg your pardon? \. All the troubles in the world. \. All the troubles in the world. That is what the United Nations was set up for.  \. I said that the price and wage controls would be put into effect as soon as it is physically possible to get it done where they are necessary. \. Will be--\. --that's the word--will.  \. The Big Four now works under the direction of the United Nations because the United Nations Charter takes the place of all those things, and the United Nations is the forum in which we have to make world peace if it can be made. It is all right for the Big Four to negotiate on things that specifically affect the Big Four, and that is what that program is for.  7  Charles Collingwood of the Columbia Broadcasting System. \. That's correct. I think negotiation is the proper way to settle all these things. That is the reason we set up the United Nations. \. All right. \. That's right, causing tension between the United Sates and Russia, if you want to be specific about it--  8 For the text of the U.S. note of December 22, 1950, see Department of State Bulletin  \. -- that's correct--that's correct. \. No, it is not. That is under the--when we settle those differences, the United Nations will be in complete operation. \. No, I do not.  \. Yes, I will tell them why. Not here. You can answer that question yourself, if you will think just a little bit about it.  9 The Defense Production Act of 1950, approved September 8, 1950 .  \. That's correct. That refers to the foreign ministers of Russia, France, Great Britain, and the United States. \. Not to the heads of state.  \. That is correct. I think eventually it is going to be necessary for a complete across-the-board proposition, but that will require some legislation, as I told you a while ago. \. How's that?\. Well, we will cross that bridge when we get to it.  \. Fine. \. No, I haven't received any such letter. \. No comment.  \. Oh, no! No comment on that.   \. I am very fond of Senator McFarland. I wrote him a letter of congratulations yesterday. \. And Senator Johnson of Texas in the same category. They are both friends of mine and always have been.  \. I think we are making the best progress that it is possible to make. I don't know whether it is satisfactory or not, that depends entirely on the viewpoint.  \. Sure.  \. I don't think it's any of their business!  \. He wanted to know if I had any comment on the London--horrification of the London tailors over the way I dress, and I said it is none of their business. \. What's the matter with the neckties ? \. Oh, did they? There are a lot of awful ones in the United Sates then.  \. All right, Smitty, 10   go ahead.  10 Merriman Smith of the United Press Associations. \. Yes, of course. That is one of the fundamental causes of the rise in the cost of living. Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President. Note: President Truman's two hundred and forty-ninth news conference was held in the Indian Treaty Room  in the Executive Office Building at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday, January 4, 1951.
