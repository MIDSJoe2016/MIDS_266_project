THE PRESIDENT, Please be seated.   I have a statement or two here for you, which I think may clear up some questions you might be inclined to ask, so I will read them to you. 
 They will be in mimeographed form outside, Tony, 1  and yes, I'll go slow. 
 I have no further comment to make on that.  3 See Item 188 .  
 I never heard of it before. It hasn't been put up to me.  
 That's the way I feel about it.   Those statements must have taken all the wind out of your sails. 
 Mr. Harriman is coming home.  4 W. Averell Harriman, Special Assistant to the President. 
 Yes. He will be home in about a week.  
 Well, we will meet that situation when it comes about.  
 I don't intend to formulate any report. I am making an investigation of conditions, with the idea of curing the patient, not killing him. 5  5 See Item 188 .  
 Everybody has a right to his guess. They made a lot of guesses in 1948.  
 Well, we hope that the negotiations will be resumed. If they want the services of Mr. Harriman, undoubtedly he would be able to go. Did you want to ask a question, Duke? 6  6 Duke Shoop of the Kansas City Star.  
 If conditions are favorable, I hope to arrive there on the 5th, Duke--be there the rest of the week.  
 No, I haven't not right recently. I heard from him about 2 weeks ago. He was getting along all right then.  7  Cordell Hull, former Secretary of State.  
 I haven't heard about that. He seems to be in great demand now.  Very capable person. Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President.  THE PRESIDENT. That's all right. Note: President Truman's two hundred and seventy-sixth news conference was held in the Indian Treaty Room  in the Executive Office Building at 4 p.m. on Thursday, August 23, 1951.
