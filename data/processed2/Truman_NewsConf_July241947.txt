 I have no special announcements to make this morning. I thought maybe you might have some questions you might like to ask me and I will try to answer them.  
 NO I Can't. As soon as I can tell you, I will let you know, so you will have plenty of time to get ready.   
 I haven't heard anything about it.  
 I haven't heard anything about that, either. 
 I will announce that when the time comes so you won't be in suspense for very long. 
 No. I will announce who is the head of it.   
 No, there is not. If there were any such action possible, I would have taken it long ago.  
 I think it has been realized to some extent. I wouldn't say just how far.  
 Well, they haven't yet reached the completeness of what they are going to do. I can't tell you anything about it until I know what they are going to do. 
 I will--I didn't say I would remove, I said I would take action. That is an entirely different thing. 
 Well, you will have to wait and see. I can't tell you until Congress has decided what it wants to do. Then I will let you know what I am going to--what I can do. 
 No, I don't think I ever made such a statement as that. 
 Wait now--just a minute--one at a time.  
 I will be glad to do that. 
 I don't remember any such statement as that in any message I ever sent to Congress. 
 On what? 
 Well, I think that was in the manner of export controls and transportation. 
 No, no. That was for export controls and transportation controls so that it would be possible to get the export-the seashore for embarkation.  
 That is under consideration. 
 I say it is under consideration. That is as far as I can go.  Pause] Reporter: Well, thank you, Mr. President.  THE PRESIDENT. Kind of a "dry hole" this morning. Note: President Truman's one hundred and thirteenth news conference was held in his office at the White House at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday, July 24, 1947.
