  I want to make a statement in connection with the fact finding boards, and this will be available in mimeographed form when you go out.   "In appointing a fact finding board in an industrial dispute where one of the questions at issue is wages, it is essential to a fulfillment of its duty that the board have the authority, whenever it deems it necessary, to examine the books of the employer. That authority is essential to enable the board to determine the ability of the employer to pay an increase in wages where such ability is in question. Ability to pay is always one of the facts relevant to the issue of an increase in wages.  "This does not mean that the Government or its fact finding board is going to endeavor to fix a rate of return for the employer. It does mean, however, that since wages are paid out of earnings, the question of earnings is relevant.  "The detailed information, obtained from the books of an employer should not be made public. Such a disclosure would place the employer at a disadvantage with respect to his competitors. But the fact finding board should unquestionably have the right to examine the employer's books where it deems it necessary in order to make up its own mind as to whether a demand for an increase is justified, and to make public all findings based on such information, that it deems relevant to the controversy.  "That is one of the things I meant when I stated in my message of December 3, 1945, to Congress, and I quote:  "'The Board should be . . . directed to make a thorough investigation of all the facts which it deems relevant in the controversy.'  "This is nothing new. There are many instances where the books of corporations are opened for inspection to representatives of the State and Federal Governments and where the information so obtained is used solely by such officials to carry out their functions.  "To confer the right to examine books is one of the main purposes of granting subpoena power to the fact finding boards. I trust that the Congress, which is the only body authorized to grant such power, will do so quickly.  "In view of the public interest involved, it would be highly unfortunate if any party to a dispute should refuse to cooperate with a fact finding board."   Now, I am going to have for release for you the letter which I sent today--identical letters to Senator Wagner and Representative Carter Manasco, in regard to the full employment bill, which is in conference--those two gentlemen are the Chairmen of the House and Senate conferees--calling attention to the fact that the Senate bill more nearly complies with the message which was sent to the Congress, and expressing the hope that the Senate bill will be adopted by the conferees. The release will speak for itself.  1    1  See Item 222.  I also want to say while--in that same connection, that I am highly appreciative of the sincere efforts that a large number of Congressmen and Senators put forth in an endeavor to get a full employment bill on the books.  Now then, I am ready for questions.  \. I think that power applies to everything that is relevant with regard to wages and prices.  \. As soon as the State Department has the thing in shape to send down. I told the people who are interested in that, that the .message would not go down until after the holidays.  \. No such intention in view. There has never been any attempt to muzzle anybody. I want everybody to express his honest opinion on the subject, and I want to get the best results that are possible. In order to do that, I want the opinions of everybody. And nobody has been muzzled.  It will be necessary now, though, for all people who are in the services, to make a statement that they are expressing their personal views and not the views of the administration. I have expressed those views myself.  \. I haven't seen that bill as yet. I will very forcibly express my opinion whenever I have seen the bill and had a chance to read it.  \. I know nothing about it. \. About any such statement, and I don't think General MacArthur has made any such statement. I know he has made no such statement to either me or the Secretary of War.  \. Well, Secretary Forrestal has been trying to resign ever since I have been here, but I hope he won't resign at a very early date.  \. They were discussing the Bulwinkle bill.  \. I don't know anything about it.  \. It is under discussion. No plan has been evolved as yet. \. No date set. We hope it will be before the 30th of June, however.  \. Why certainly--why certainly. It will be a fact finding board to arrive at its opinion for anything that they deem relevant in the controversy.  \. There is no comment.  \. Well, on the right to get the information that is necessary to settle the controversy. Congress can delegate that power to anybody. \. Anything. \. Well, I hope they won't take that attitude, because that won't reflect to their credit.  \. One of the first things I received was the resignation of Dr. Tugwell. I asked him to stay. \. Yes, he did. \. Yes, I still want him to stay. \. Let me answer this lady's question.  \. I think the Senate version is the best version of the full employment bill. That is what I wanted to get over.  \. For a while, yes. \. Well, I can't state that. I don't know.  \. Not that I know of. And if they were relevant to investigating, the subpoena power would be there.  \. It has been expressed at Potsdam. If you will read the Potsdam Declaration, you will find it.  \. No. No comment on that.  \. The only authority they have is under the War Powers Act. We have got all the power existing under the War Powers Act. \. I am very sorry to hear that. I hope he will reconsider that and not do it.  \. No.  \. That would be purely voluntary. They have not got the power, and nobody can give that power but the Congress.  \. I Would not. \. Thank you.  Voices: Merry Christmas!  THE PRESIDENT. Merry Christmas to all of you. I hope you have a grand Christmas, all of you.
