 Well, I have no particular announcements to make to you, but I will try to answer your questions, if you want to ask me.  \. Well, I guess that's just to add to the obfuscation of all the rest of his statement.  That's about in line with what he's trying to say.  \. No comment.  \. That is still-- \. --still in the hands of the Department of Labor.  \. No, I do not.  \. Well, I think we will just wait a little while and see. It will be an issue, of course. Whether it will be the main issue or not, I don't know.  \. No comment. \. Mr. Pauley has a job. At least he is my representative on the Reparations Commission.  \. No.  \. Well, it should not have been published at this time, because it is still in the negotiation stage. \. Well, I have no control of Mr. Morrison. I have some control of Mr. Grady. \. I don't know. Of course not. Mr. Grady is still working on the job. \. No. Still working at the job.  \. No, I haven't. It is still going through the mill. I haven't received it--or I haven't had the report on it as yet.  \. What was the nature of the interview? I don't think I read it. \. Well, I am happy to hear that, but I haven't read the interview.  \. The obfuscation.  \. Well, I will spell it for you. I had it looked up in the dictionary. It means deceit or deception, and it is spelled i-n-g-a-n-n-a-i-o-n.  I don't use $40 words like that in my language.\. That's a Republican word. It isn't Democratic.  \. It says so here. I never saw the word until I heard or saw it in the paper, and then I had to get a dictionary and look it up. \. Not at all. It's just a plain statement of the facts as they are, and nothing else. \. Yes, I discussed it with Dr. Hassett.  Dr. Hassett's opinion was the same as mine, that it was a good Republican word, and that the Democrats wouldn't use it.  \. Obfuscation? That means to mess you up, Tony. 1      1 Ernest B. Vaccaro of the Associated Press. \. Yes, that's a Democratic word.   \. Sure. \. I do not.  \. No, we are still working on it. I am not ready to make an announcement on it. As soon as I can I will immediately announce it, whenever I have the answer.  \. No, I haven't seen it. It probably won't.  \. He will be elected--he will be elected. That's a categorical statement. \. I have no comment to make on the Missouri primary. \. I have not. \. No, I have not officially. All I know is what I have seen in the papers. I know that their investigation is going forward with all the energy possible.  \. That question is perfectly obvious: No!   You know the budget would have been balanced except for the passage of the terminal leave pay bill, which was not anticipated by me in the first budget, and which was unanimously passed by the House, Mr. Brown voting for it. So it is a two-party measure, and both parties are ready to take the credit for it, as is the President of the United States. And that's what caused the deficit.  \. Just as soon as we can find the room, we are going to move them all back to Washington. \. Well, I don't--I can't answer the question. lust as quickly as we can get it done. We are trying to move all those agencies back where they belong as quickly as possible. \. Yes, it takes everything \. Yes, very badly crowded here, and as soon as it's possible, we are moving all those regular governmental functions back to Washington. \. Oh no, it won't be immediately. It will be as soon as possible.  \. No he hasn't. \. Well now, this is a negotiation of a peace treaty openly arrived at, and it's--every day's report is all public, on the same basis as that proposed by Woodrow Wilson, so you know every day just as much as I do about it.  \. I think it is, and I anticipate it coming to my desk at any moment now. \. I haven't received it yet.  \. Yes. All signed but about 40--approved or disapproved whatever is necessary to be done with them. think I signed about 180. Still 40 or 50 left.  \. No, I can't. Just as soon as I get to it I will inform you promptly. \. No, there isn't. \. No, I haven't. \. This has nothing to do with the treaty or the Constitution. I don't think the Constitution enters into it at all. The New York Times had a very learned article on the subject this morning, which was interesting to me.  Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President.  THE PRESIDENT. You're welcome. Note: President Truman's seventy-eighth news conference was held in his office at the White House at 4:05 p.m. on Friday, August 9, 1946.
