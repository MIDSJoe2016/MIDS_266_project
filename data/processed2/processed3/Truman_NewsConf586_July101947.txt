 I have no special announcements to make this morning. I thought maybe you might have some questions you might like to ask me.  \. I told Senator Barkley that I didn't see any reason why my attitude should change if they sent me the same bill they did before.  \. Well, I have told you, I think, on numerous occasions, that the Missouri Valley Authority is the best way to control the Missouri Valley, but that doesn't affect the flood situation on the Des Moines River, or the Mississippi River or the Ohio River. We are trying to work out a comprehensive flood control program for the whole Mississippi Valley. \. I think I have said it a dozen times. You want me to put it down in writing and hand it to you?  \. Why not? That is the only bill that is pending on the subject. Murray  1  was in here and had a conference with me just the other day, and I told him to push the bill.  1  Senator James E. Murray. \. Why of course. I have always actively supported it. \. Who doesn't think so? \. Uh huh. \. I shall support the comprehensive flood control program. That is the emergency at the present time, not the Missouri Valley Authority.  \. No. That is still in contemplation.  \. Not that I know of. Nobody put him up to me that I know of. \. We hope to be able to make announcements in a short time. As soon as I am able to make the announcements, I will let you know right away. \. The successor to Judge Collet will be announced just as soon as I am ready to send it up. 1   1  See Item 174.  \. Well, that is a matter for the Congress to decide. When it comes up to me I will act on it. Congress has control on taxation and the collection of revenue. \. No. The Congress has to decide on that.  \. Yes. \. NO. That is--it may-- the Marshall plan may come up, but it is particularly to discuss the displaced persons situation--the message which I sent. 2   2  See Item 140.  \. I had no thoughts on the matter. Of course, if it is necessary for the Congress to be called back, it will be called. I don't anticipate that there will be any necessity for it.  \. Only in the newspapers.  \. Only the explanations I have seen in the newspapers. Did you ever hear of the moon hoax ?  \. No comment. That is a contract strictly between the owners and the miners. I have no comment on it. 1   1  See Item 142. \. None that I know of. Mark Sullivan probably can tell you.   \. None. \. None. \. I was just saying that no plans were made for any trip anywhere.  \. I think Senator Hickenlooper very clearly explained the situation in his statement to the Senate. He is chairman of that committee, and I am perfectly willing to accept his statement on the matter. They have been investigating it. 1   1  see congressional Record .  \. I have no attitude.  \. All I know about it is the memorandum that you sent in to me, Tony. 2    2  Ernest B. Vaccaro of the Associated Press. \. I consider the source of the remarks which you said were made in the speech by Mr. Slaughter, so it doesn't worry me any.  \. NO, I don't see any reason why they shouldn't. Congress understands it much better than I do. \. Well, that is up to the Congress. That is none of my business. I don't intend to adjourn them myself.   \. The--if the necessity arises we certainly will take whatever steps are necessary. \. I don't see any necessity in the immediate future now, but of course if the necessity arises we will do whatever is necessary to meet the situation. \. No. \. I can't make any recommendations on that situation until we find out how the Paris conference goes.  \. I hadn't heard about it, and I don't think Dr. Steelman has, either. I think he is pretty well satisfied working 24 hours a day for me.  How about it, John?  Dr. Steelman: About right.  \. NO comment.  Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President.  THE PRESIDENT. You're welcome. Note: President Truman's one hundred and eleventh news conference was held in his office at the White House at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday, July 10, 1947.
