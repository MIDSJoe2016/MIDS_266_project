 I haven't anything of any great importance today. Justfor background and to quiet some of the recent rumors for you, I can tell you that Messrs.  Wilbur,  Mitchell, and  Hyde are not going to resign from the Cabinet. That is not for quotation but just so that you will know. And in case that hardy perennial about Mr.  Mellon turns up, you can be satisfied that that won't happen either.\. Yes. The Wilbur one seems to be happening every Friday now. But otherwise I haven't anything at all today. If you can think up some device by which we can stir public interest you might let me know. Note: President Hoover's one hundred and eighty-fourth news conference was held in the White House at 4 p.m. on Friday, April 3, 1931.
