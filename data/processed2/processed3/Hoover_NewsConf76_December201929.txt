 Well, I have a complete blank on this occasion, and I don't think that we will bother to have a conference on Tuesday. You will want to go away for Christmas, and I will be too lazy, so I wish to take this occasion to wish you a merry Christmas, and will have a chance to wish you a happy new year later on.\. I hadn't thought about it, but now that you mention it I will take your advice.\. I have none. The house is making the usual preparation of green and things that belong to the season. I don't expect to go away and there is nothing special happening.\. One or two turkeys already in. Note: President Hoover's seventy-sixth news conference was held in the White House at 4 p.m. on Friday, December 20, 1929.
