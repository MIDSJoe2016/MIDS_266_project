  Oh, I guess so. This is not collusive on the part of Fred and myself.  I guessed that somebody -  MR. STORM: As a matter of fact, Mr. President, I had the dope last week down at Warm Springs that there was some movement on foot for you to sound off against Mr. O'Connor but I held it up too late and I was scooped in the Sunday morning papers.  I knew that somebody would ask the question so I have a perfectly good statement here. It is long. I shall read it to you and I shall give it to Steve and he will give you copies so you won't have to take it down.  The Court plan was not in the platform, but the Court plan is no longer an issue because, in effect, we obtained ninety-eight per cent of all the objectives intended by the Court plan. I made that clear on many occasions.  No. That is a perfectly fair statement. How-ever, it won't prevent the continued use of the assertion, will it?  Frankly, I have not heard anything about the Kansas situation.  Really, it is honestly true that I have no plans and no dates after this coming trip. I suppose I have had invitations to go into forty-eight states, including Vermont and Maine. But I have no plans whatsoever.  If you must know, I will tell you, my mother.(Laughter) But she is in Campobello.
