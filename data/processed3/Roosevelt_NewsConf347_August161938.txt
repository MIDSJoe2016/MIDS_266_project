Q. Mr. President, have you anything to say about the forthcoming primaries in New York where Congressman O'Connor is running against Jim Fay? THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I guess so. This is not collusive on the part of Fred and myself.  I guessed that somebody MR. STORM: As a matter of fact, Mr. President, I had the dope last week down at Warm Springs that there was some movement on foot for you to sound off against Mr. O'Connor but I held it up too late and I was scooped in the Sunday morning papers. THE PRESIDENT: I knew that somebody would ask the question so I have a perfectly good statement here. It is long. I shall read it to you and I shall give it to Steve and he will give you copies so you won't have to take it down.\. The Court plan was not in the platform, but the Court plan is no longer an issue because, in effect, we obtained ninety-eight per cent of all the objectives intended by the Court plan. I made that clear on many occasions. Q. In other words, any disfavor you may hold to any member of the House or Senate is not based on the Court plan? THE PRESIDENT: No. That is a perfectly fair statement. How-ever, it won't prevent the continued use of the assertion, will it? Q. I hate to bother you with so much state politics, but out in Kansas it looks like a pretty bitter fight between Clyde Reed and Senator McGill. Mr. Reed supported you in 1936 and did not support Governor Landon. I wondered if you were going out that way any time in the fall? THE PRESIDENT: Frankly, I have not heard anything about the Kansas situation. Q. Do you contemplate going into Wisconsin and Minnesota? THE PRESIDENT: Really, it is honestly true that I have no plans and no dates after this coming trip. I suppose I have had invitations to go into forty-eight states, including Vermont and Maine. But I have no plans whatsoever. Q. Who asked you to go into Maine? THE PRESIDENT: If you must know, I will tell you, my mother.(Laughter) But she is in Campobello.
