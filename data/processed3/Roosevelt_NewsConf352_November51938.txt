Q. Mr. President, before you get down to the unimportant things, I would like to ask you a national question: Have you settled the matter of the Gravelly Point airport?  It may sound funny, but it is important, sir. THE PRESIDENT: I will tell you; last Friday at Cabinet meeting, it was discovered that there were three different opinions from three groups of lawyers. Of course that creates a very difficult situation!  So I referred the matter to the Department of Justice with the request that they straighten it out and make it legal to go ahead with Gravelly Point. At six o'clock that same night, they telephoned they had done it, and it is now legal.\. Read the newspapers for the past five years. Q. Mr. President, are you discussing the position of the Philippines in the new plan? THE PRESIDENT: The American flag floats over the Philippines . . . .
