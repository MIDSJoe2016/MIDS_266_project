  I will tell you; last Friday at Cabinet meeting, it was discovered that there were three different opinions from three groups of lawyers. Of course that creates a very difficult situation!  So I referred the matter to the Department of Justice with the request that they straighten it out and make it legal to go ahead with Gravelly Point. At six o'clock that same night, they telephoned they had done it, and it is now legal.  Read the newspapers for the past five years.  The American flag floats over the Philippines . . . .
