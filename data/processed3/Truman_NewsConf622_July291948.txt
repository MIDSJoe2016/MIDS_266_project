 Ladies and gentlemen, I have no announcements to make. If you have any questions, I will try to answer them.  \. I haven't seen what General Bradley says, but I am informed by the Secretary for the Army that he made no such statement.  \. I haven't seen Mr. Bevin's statement, and I have no comment to make on it, or on the European situation.  \. That is a matter that the Senate will have to act on, and the House. The House has already acted, I think.  \. Yes.  \. I have no comment to make on the Senate. The Senate stands before the country just the same as I do. They will have to take the consequences of their acts.  \. Not necessarily.  \. No.   \. The change in the situation. \. Well, consumer credit is rapidly rising. \. Yes. \. I cannot. \. I cannot do it. The authority to do that was repealed. \. I did not see Mr. Wolcott's statement, but I think he is mistaken.  1  Representative Jesse P. Wolcott of Michigan. \. Did he? Well, maybe he doesn't interpret the law the same way I do. I have to take the Attorney General's rulings. \. It's a brake on buying on credit, and paying for it in payments. \. Installment buying. \. It requires authority from the Congress for the Federal Reserve Board to reinstate it, as I understand it. I will have the Attorney General go into that. If there is a congressional law and we have the power, we will use it. \. Well, it was in his opinion proper for the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to appear first, which he did today. \. Well now, that's a matter for the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to settle between themselves, and however they settle it, it's all right with me. They will both appear eventually.  THE PRESIDENT . What's the matter? \. I will give you a copy of it, Tony. 1   1  Ernest B. Vaccaro of the Associated Press. \. I have made no campaign plans whatever.  \. No comment.  \. I do not.  \. I did not mention it. \. I did not mention it. The platform mentioned it, Miss May. 2    2  Mrs. May Craig of the Portland  Press Herald. \. I did not mention it. That is a matter that originated in Congress. It has never been on a program of mine. If Congress wants to act on it, I will be glad to sign the bill. \. Oleo. \. Sure, I will be glad to. \. I said I would sign it if it came up here. Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President. Note: President Truman's one hundred and fifty-first news conference was held in his office at the White House at 4 p.m. on Thursday, July 29, 1948.
