 The Engineers and Trainmen have agreed to postpone the strike date from 4 o'clock, May 18, to 4 o'clock, May 23.  That is in response to a request that I made from them, by giving them assurance that I was sure that further progress could be made in the negotiations with the railways if they were willing to negotiate further.  Now, get this carefully: The Trainmen's key word--the Trainmen's key word for Postponement is Convention; the Engineers' key word for postponement is Johnston-J-o-h-n-s-t-o-n.  I called them at 3 o'clock, and they called me back at 3:34, and accepted the suggestion. 
 Yes. 
 I called them at 3 o'clock, and then they called hack at 3:34. 
 Use the word "move" instead of "postpone" there. The Engineers and Trainmen have agreed to move the strike date from 4 o'clock, May 18, to 4 o'clock, May 23. 
 That means they will not strike.  Dr. Steelman: The Trainmen will not strike.  THE PRESIDENT. The Trainmen will not strike. 
 Assured them that I was confident that further progress could be made, if they were willing to negotiate further. 
 No, I didn't; but I am confident that that will happen. 
 They will be resumed immediately. 
 For postponement of the strike for moving the strike date. The key word is to call off the strike at this time. 
 Johnston--J-o-h-n-s-t-o-n. 
 Yes. They will fly here tomorrow. 
 I talked to Whitney and Johnston. 
 That's all right. Note: President Truman's sixty-sixth news conference was held in his office at the White House at 3:53 p.m. on Saturday, May 18, 1946.
