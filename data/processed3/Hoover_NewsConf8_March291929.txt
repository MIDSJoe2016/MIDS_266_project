 There is no use getting out your paper because the only questions I have today relate to matters that I am unable to make any announcement about. ARMS LIMITATION CONFERENCE I have one question on instructions to limitation of arms conference. That also must be delayed until Mr. Stimson can say something about it himself. So I am dry of anything, and it is your fault THE PRESIDENT'S WEEKEND PLANS\. The family wants to go on a picnic tomorrow, and we thought we would go up into the Shenandoah hills--back tomorrow night. POSTMASTER APPOINTMENTS\. No, not at the present time--haven't come to any conclusions about that. So I am sorry that I cannot give you some warranty for this appearance. Note: President Hoover's eighth news conference was held in the White House at 4 p.m. on Friday, March 29, 1929.
