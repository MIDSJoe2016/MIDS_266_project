 Anticipating what you are going to ask and in order to save time , I know approximately what is on your minds and I want to be helpful if I can. Therefore I am going to give you this statement for direct quotation. Get out your pencils.  "I know only what I have read in the newspapers. I know that the stories are appearing serially" - not seriously, I said "serially" - "and their publication is not complete. Mr. Justice Black is in Europe where, undoubtedly, he cannot get the full text of these articles. Until such time as he returns, there is no further comment to be made." That is all.  "I know only what I have read in the newspapers. I know that the stories are appearing serially and their publication is not complete. Mr. Justice Black is in Europe where, undoubtedly, he cannot get the full text of these articles. Until such time as he returns, there is no further comment to be made."  No.  No; I said, "No."  No.  No.  That is an "if" question.  I don't know. . . .  I think we will probably have something - I don't know whether you will get it tonight or tomorrow-in regard to shipping headed for the Far East. I cannot give you anything because it is not written out yet.  I don't know whether it will be ready tonight or whether you will have to wait until tomorrow.  No, it will be general.  I think the Wichita at the present time is proceeding from one American port to another.  That is always under consideration and has been for weeks.   "Until such time as he returns, there is no further comment to be made."  No, don't write yourself out on a limb.
