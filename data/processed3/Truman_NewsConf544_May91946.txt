 I have no special announcements to make to you this morning. I thought you ought to have at least one press conference this week, so if you want to ask me any questions, I will try to answer them.  \. Beg your pardon? \. Yes, they are going forward, and I will have some plans to send to the Congress in a very short time.  \. No. I think the loan is just as important as that. \. Yes, I have, and I will continue to use them. \. I haven't gone into that thoroughly yet. We are making that survey now. \. I haven't seen the resolution, and I don't know what it provides. I have not been consulted about it.  \. No.  \. It is slowly and gradually approaching that stage. \. I haven't gone into that phase of the situation, but I think the Wagner Labor Relations Act provides against that very thing.  \. My understanding is that it is paid to a trustee for the use of the union--it isn't paid to the union. \. That's right. That's a different thing. \. Different thing.\. That's a different thing.  \. I am hoping they will get together. \. I don't think they have rejected it as yet. Let's wait a while and see if it doesn't work out.  \. I have inquired of two or three high-powered gentlemen if they would take it. I have had no acceptances as yet.   \. The law provides for the appointment of one in the airplane strike, and there is no law providing for one in the coal strike. \. Civil Aeronautics Authority. \. I will cross that bridge when I get to it.  \. No, I do not--as yet. Whenever that time comes, why Mr. Byrnes will be authorized to make an announcement on it.  \. I haven't seen the letter.  \. I haven't given that any thought, or any study. Whenever that comes up to me, I will take action. \. I asked for a law back in December, but they refused me. \. I think it would be a good thing.  \. Yes. \. The draft law is in a very bad situation. I am very sorry action was not taken more promptly on it. It was urged, I think, as far back as last September.  \. No. I don't remember receiving anything but a letter enclosing some stamps which Egypt has issued, and he wrote me a letter and sent me those stamps. It had nothing to do with any international affairs whatever.   \. Yes, I have read them. \. Well, as I commented at the Gridiron dinner: hindsight is a great thing.  \. I do not, and I don't think there is one.  \. No, I haven't heard about it, and I make the policy.   \. I would rather not discuss it today. I will discuss it at a later date for you. I would like to discuss it, but I am not ready to do so. \. No. I haven't contemplated that. \. I have that under consideration. \. I would rather not discuss it at this time.  \. I can't answer that, because I--[laughing]--I haven't been there myself to make the investigation. Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President.  THE PRESIDENT. You're welcome.
