SAMUEL H. THOMPSON THE PRESIDENT. There is nothing new aside from the appointment of Sam Thompson as a member of the Federal Farm Board. This is the most excitement Washington has had. I have no news further than this. Nothing that you could term new. You can ask verbal questions this time, if you wish. QUESTIONS
 It has not worked today. He was trying to get it through on the set he made. 
 I would like to, but I don't believe I can go fishing. It seems very inapropos to catch small fish with a large boat.
 No, I do not think so. I want to stick close to American soil.
 I have not given a great deal of attention to this, I shall probably give a 10 or 15 minute speech at some point.
 This is going to be merely a response of greetings. There will be no expression of policy. I want to see something of the government and visualize the sentiment of the people. 
 Yes, at Ponce. He will meet us at Ponce. 
 I haven't any at all. You could shake hands with the whole population of the Virgin Islands in 4 hours. These are days to sleep and I do not think that anyone expects you to send many news dispatches.
 It all depends how everyone feels. There are no rules about this voyage. If there is anyone who feels like it I shall have preparations made for it. I think 3 days sleep would do us all good. I am taking it all out mostly in sleep. Note: President Hoover's one hundred and eighty-first news conference was held on board U.S.S. Arizona, en route from Norfolk, Va., to Ponce, P.R., at 2 p.m. on Friday, March 20, 1931.
