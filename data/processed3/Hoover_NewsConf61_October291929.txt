 I am sorry, but this is one of those days when I haven't anything that I can very well discuss. I have one or two questions, but I am not quite ready with the data behind them, so that I can't make a competent statement on them. And you seem to be able to find a supply of news elsewhere. DEATH OF SENATOR THEODORE F. BURTON\. I just sent one. So I am afraid I can't help you any this morning.\. Yes.
