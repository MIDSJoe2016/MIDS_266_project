15TH DECENNIAL CENSUS  The census starts tomorrow, that is, the decennial enumeration of the whole of the 120 millions of people, and I am very much in hopes that the whole country will cooperate in making it expeditious and effective. The values which flow from the census taking are of paramount importance both from a point of view of government, economic advancement, social determinations, and every person in the country has an interest in making it absolutely effective. It furnishes a datum point from which we move in every advancement of the country. Other than that I have no information for today.  I think I will furnish it as the head of the family.
