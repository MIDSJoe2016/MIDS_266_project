  I would not say we have given up hope. Nobody can tell what will happen. Those peace objectives are still as sound today, from the point of view of democracies, as they were then.  Yes, that is true. I had that in mind but forgot it. Freedom from want - in other words, the removal of certain barriers between nations, cultural in the first place and commercial in the second place. That is the fifth, very definitely.  There are a great many people actually in this country who are so "hipped" on the efficiency of the new type of Government that, as I say, they are willing to compromise, willing to keep their mouths shut; they are willing by silence to give the impression of acquiescence.  Oh, no; I am just talking philosophically, not politically.
