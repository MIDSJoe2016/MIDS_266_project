 We are awfully glad to have Mr. Churchill back here. I don't have to tell him that. All he has to do is to read the papers, and look into the faces of any American. He is very welcome. I don't think we have very much to tell you, except that we are making exceedingly good progress, and considering the size of our problems- the global nature of the war - these discussions have been done in practically record time. And so I am going to turn the meeting over to Mr. Churchill, and I think that he will be willing to answer almost- with stress on the almost- any question.   I think that word "molestation," or "molesting" is one of the best examples of your habitual understatement that I know.   You know, I think that's something that hasn't been brought out, and that is that the night bombing over Europe carries more weight of explosives; but of course being night-time the precision of the actual bombing can't be so great as the day bombing, which carries less explosives but with more precision because it's daylight. On the whole, the combination of the two, day and night, is achieving a more and more satisfactory result. THE PRIME MINISTER: It's like running a twenty-four-hour service. ...  May I say one word, please? Don't get the idea that our conferences are concluded. They are not. They are continuing.  THE PRIME MINISTER: We have a lot of ground to cover.  Yes.
