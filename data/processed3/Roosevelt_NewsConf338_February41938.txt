  Yes, and no. The origin, of course, is perfectly simple. We got in the White House, beginning about two months ago, a large number of letters saying, "Please, can we come down to Washington? Why don't you pay the same attention to us?" There were hundreds of them that wanted some kind of a conference in Washington. It was perfectly vague, but they wanted to be here. Of course, to a good many of them we wrote back and said it was impossible to see everybody individually and would they write their views. They still kept coming back and saying, "We would like to come to Washington." There were a good many hundreds of them. We were confused, quite frankly, with the dilemma. If we said "No" to them, certain agencies in the country would say that we were turning them down. If we invited them down here, it would be very difficult to handle a group of that kind. But I do not think it is a fair thing to ridicule either them or their efforts.  Yes, largely. I think entirely. They were all people who had written letters.  I don't know. I have not heard from them.  It goes in line with everything I have always said, always. Now, do not misinterpret that. There are lots of ways of misinterpreting it.  I will just give you one thought on it. You know we talked a good deal about a floor for Agriculture. Well, just use the analogy on wages. The Agricultural bill does not attempt, in any way, to set the price on corn or the price on anything else. All it does is sets a floor. Use the same analogy on wages and you will about hit it right. . . .
