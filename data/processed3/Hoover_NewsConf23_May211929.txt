THE O'FALLON DECISION AND RAILWAY RATES  I have some questions about the effect of the O'Fallon decision, and you can say, if you wish, that I am confident that there will be no increase in railway rates as the result of the O'Fallon decision. LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMISSION I also have some questions about the meeting of the Law Enforcement Commission. I have asked the Commission to meet at the Cabinet Room here at 2:30 next Tuesday afternoon.  That comprises my entire budget. The Commission will meet for organization purposes and hope to get under way with its work promptly.  The Commission will determine that. I cannot forecast how they will do their work. RAILWAY RATES  Yes, if you like. I would like to have you get it accurately. "I am confident there will be no increase in railway rates as the result of the O'Fallon decision."
