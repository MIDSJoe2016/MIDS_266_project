  The first announcement I want to make is that the Message on the State of the Nation and the Budget Message will go down together on Monday.  On Saturday morning at 10:30, in the White House movie theater, we will discuss the Budget Message with those who are interested, as is usually done each year. Now I am ready for questions. \. No. It was a decision shortly arrived at, that one message is enough. The State of the Union Message and the Budget Message will go down together. \. It will be one document.  \. They have been released ever since they met. I have no strings on them.   \. It did not include New York politics. \. Everything else under the sun. Oh, personal matters, principally.  \. Those that we do not need will be placed under a U.N.O. trusteeship. \. We will keep.\. We will keep. \. That depends. As long as we need them. \. Yes. Yes, it will be under an individual trusteeship. \. That's right. \. I beg your pardon? \. Yes. Just like all the rest of them. \. Well, no. It will be through collective trusteeships, in most instances. \. That is not necessarily the case. We will have to work those things out as we come to them, and inaugurate the policy as we go along. \. Yes.  \. All I know is what I see in the papers. \. The House, which is considering it, should be allowed to vote on it the same as any other legislation.  \. No comment. I approved the report of the fact-finding commission. \. I am not familiar with the contract--of course, I am glad that the collective bargaining in that case was a success. That's all I can say about it. I have never seen the contract.  \. I can't answer that. All I know is that be made the proposal and then Murray made the counterproposal. It all took place before he came here. \. I can't answer that. You will have to ask Mr. Fairless. \. It was not. \. No, it was not.  \. What leading architects?[Laughter]  1  A White House release, dated January 11, outlined plans for the work, noting that the $1,650,000 construction project would be divided into four main units:  addition to the Executive Offices;  completion of the East Wing;  interior alterations to the Mansion; and  landscaping and improvements to the grounds. \. I have never been in touch with the American Institute of Architects. And the Park and Planning Commission have approved the program, and all the architects we have talked to are in favor of the program. And it is built principally for your benefit. I am going to have an auditorium in which you gentlemen can sit down and ask me questions.  \. Well, I feel that way, too. But this has no connection whatever with the White House. This is an addition to the offices of the President. \. They don't want the President to have any offices to work in. It's just something to talk about.  \. Only in conjunction with our allies. \. We have not. \. Yes, I am.  \. Because I think it is necessary that they should be combined. The State of the Union is wrapped up in the Budget. \. Well, I didn't necessarily mean to send two. After giving the matter a great deal of study, I came to the conclusion that one message would be just as good as two, and in fact a little better, I think. \. Well, it will be long enough to keep you busy for quite some time.   \. He did discuss it with me. We have been looking into that situation for quite some time and are trying to take the necessary steps to prevent those implements of destruction from getting into the wrong hands.  \. No, I have not. That hasn't been discussed with me.  \. Management didn't take much interest in that fact-finding report, and I hope that they will at a later date.  \. I think General Eisenhower covered that very thoroughly this morning before the Congress, as did the Navy. I have a copy of the statement here, which I haven't had a chance to read yet.  \. I think it is doing remarkably well. And I think it is going to accomplish the purpose for which it was intended; that is, keep the future peace. \. Let me answer the lady's question, and then I will answer yours.  \. NO. They did not have facts enough to base any preliminary report on.  \. There are not.  \. I don't think so. I sent a special message on that, and that special message still stands.  \. We have been asking the Selective Service for So, odd a month. I think the greatest number they have ever got was 37,000. \. I don't know of anything. Selective Service has that.  \. No. \. I have had no official word on it. All I know about it is what I have seen, the Post article in the paper.  \. After the annual message goes up, yes.  \. No. I think a fact finding setup would answer the purpose. It has worked very satisfactorily in the railroad program, and that was where I got the idea. I have been on the Interstate Commerce Committee of the Senate, and studied that situation very thoroughly, and have appointed, since I have been President, several fact-finding committees for railroad disputes. They worked very successfully. \. I think the General Motors strike would have been settled, if that had been done.  \. We decided to hold it up for a future release until General Marshall's job is completed in China. \. No. It will be released at a very much later date. Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President. Note: President Truman's forty-third news conference was held in his office at the White House at 4:05 p.m. on Tuesday, January 15, 1946. The White House Official Reporter noted that John R. Steelman, Special Assistant to the President, John W. Snyder, Director of the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion, and Postmaster General Robert E. Hannegan were present at the conference.
