  You will have to ask them on the Hill.  I think I shall have to reframe your question: Have you any comment on the Supreme Court decision?  On this particular decision the only thing I can say is that it will be and is of very great interest to practically everybody in the United States. They should read all three opinions, the opinion of Justice Butler, the opinion of the Chief Justice, and the opinion of Justice Stone, because it is the combination of the three that indicates that for the present a majority of the Court have made one fact fairly clear. I am, of course, interested in that fact because when I was Governor of New York we did discuss and, just after I left, the Legislature passed this minimum-wage law. It seems to be fairly clear, as a result of this decision and former decisions, using this question of minimum wage as an example, that the "no-man's-land" where no Government restate or Federal - can function is being more clearly defined. A State cannot do it, and the Federal Government cannot do it. I think, from the layman's point of view, that is the easiest way of putting it and about all we can say on it.  I think that is about all there is to say on it.(Laughter)  I think that is all there is to say about it. . . .
