  I think if we can avoid reference to individuals, it is all right to talk about the general principle. I have felt all along that it is not quite in accord with the spirit of the Administration that any individual who holds a high Party position, such as National Committeeman, should earn a livelihood by practicing law, because, in a sense, he holds himself out as having access to the back door of the Administration. It just "is not done." . . .
